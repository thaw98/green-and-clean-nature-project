            <h1>DEFINITION OF ECOSYSTEM</h1>
            <p>
              An ecosystem is a geographic area where plants, animals, and other
              organisms, as well as weather and landscape, work together to form
              a bubble of life. Ecosystems contain biotic or living, parts, as
              well as abiotic factors, or nonliving parts. Biotic factors
              include plants, animals, and other organisms. Abiotic factors
              include rocks, temperature, and humidity.
            </p>

                Many people only think of animals when they learn of ecosystems,
                but in reality, an ecosystem has animals, plants, and NON-living
                things too. Animals need to hide inside rocks and dead trees.
                Water is needed to drink and some animals live in the water. Air
                is a non-living part of an eocsystem as well — all animals need
                air.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some ecosystems provide special services for the entire world.
                For example, even though rainforests only cover 6% of Earth,
                they produce about 40% of the oxygen in the atmosphere through
                photosynthesis. Other ecosystems produce food, medicine, and
                helpful materials like rubber and lumber.

                Animals usually need food, water, and shelter.

                This means adapting to be able to survive the climatic
                conditions of the ecosystem, predators, and other species that
                compete for the same food and space. An adaptation is a
                modification or change in the organism's body or behaviour that
                helps it to survive.

              When you think of an ecosystem, such as a forest, there are many
              organisms that are important. Trees, deer, plants, birds,
              squirrels, and insects are prominent members of the ecosystem.
              There are many more organisms that live in an ecosystem that are
              not as noticeable.
            </p>
            <p>
              We often forget about all the bacteria, fungus, and tiny insects
              that are equally important. Ecosystems depend on many organisms to
              keep them in balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              When that balance is disrupted organisms cannot thrive, and some
              may even die. Possible disruptions caused by humans include
              pollution, deforestation, land development, or removing too many
              resources like water. Making wise choices to protect ecosystems
              will help all the living things continue to live and thrive. It’s
              important to remember that not all disruptions are caused by
              humans, some happen naturally.
