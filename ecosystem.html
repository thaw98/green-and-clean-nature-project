            <h1>DEFINITION OF ECOSYSTEM</h1>
            <p>
              An ecosystem is a geographic area where plants, animals, and other
              organisms, as well as weather and landscape, work together to form
              a bubble of life. Ecosystems contain biotic or living, parts, as
              well as abiotic factors, or nonliving parts. Biotic factors
              include plants, animals, and other organisms. Abiotic factors
              include rocks, temperature, and humidity.
            </p>

                Many people only think of animals when they learn of ecosystems,
                but in reality, an ecosystem has animals, plants, and NON-living
                things too. Animals need to hide inside rocks and dead trees.
                Water is needed to drink and some animals live in the water. Air
                is a non-living part of an eocsystem as well — all animals need
                air.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some ecosystems provide special services for the entire world.
                For example, even though rainforests only cover 6% of Earth,
                they produce about 40% of the oxygen in the atmosphere through
                photosynthesis. Other ecosystems produce food, medicine, and
                helpful materials like rubber and lumber.

                All organisms have needs, such as food, water, and air. If the
                needs of the organisms in the ecosystem are not met, they cannot
                survive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Animals usually need food, water, and shelter.
                <br />
                <b
                  >For example: if deer need to eat grass and the place they
                  live in (their ecosystem) no longer has grass, they have to
                  move somewhere else or risk not surviving.</b

                This means adapting to be able to survive the climatic
                conditions of the ecosystem, predators, and other species that
                compete for the same food and space. An adaptation is a
                modification or change in the organism's body or behaviour that
                helps it to survive.
