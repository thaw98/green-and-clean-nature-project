            <h1>Definition of Ecosystem</h1>
            <p>
              An ecosystem is a geographic area where plants, animals, and other
              organisms, as well as weather and landscape, work together to form
              a bubble of life. Ecosystems contain biotic or living, parts, as
              well as abiotic factors, or nonliving parts. Biotic factors
              include plants, animals, and other organisms. Abiotic factors
              include rocks, temperature, and humidity.
            </p>

                Many people only think of animals when they learn of ecosystems,
                but in reality, an ecosystem has animals, plants, and NON-living
                things too. Animals need to hide inside rocks and dead trees.
                Water is needed to drink and some animals live in the water. Air
                is a non-living part of an eocsystem as well — all animals need
                air.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some ecosystems provide special services for the entire world.
                For example, even though rainforests only cover 6% of Earth,
                they produce about 40% of the oxygen in the atmosphere through
                photosynthesis. Other ecosystems produce food, medicine, and
                helpful materials like rubber and lumber.

                modification or change in the organism's body or behaviour that
                helps it to survive.

                When you think of an ecosystem, such as a forest, there are many
                organisms that are important. Trees, deer, plants, birds,
                squirrels, and insects are prominent members of the ecosystem.
                There are many more organisms that live in an ecosystem that are
                not as noticeable.
              </p>
              <p>
                We often forget about all the bacteria, fungus, and tiny insects
                that are equally important. Ecosystems depend on many organisms
                to keep them in balance.
              </p>
              <p>
                When that balance is disrupted organisms cannot thrive, and some
                may even die. Possible disruptions caused by humans include
                pollution, deforestation, land development, or removing too many
                resources like water. Making wise choices to protect ecosystems
                will help all the living things continue to live and thrive.
                It’s important to remember that not all disruptions are caused
                by humans, some happen naturally.

                inches of rain per year). All that rain allows lots of different
                plants to grow and lots of animals live near those plants.
                Rainforests also produce a lot of oxygen that humans breathe and

                Rainforest ecosystems contain lots of plants. Plants provide
                food and homes for animals like birds and butterflies. Birds
                build nests in plants. Bugs eat leaves of plants and birds drink
                nectar from flowers. Some plants also make fruit which animals
                eat.

                Rainforests cover only about 6 percent of the planet but are
                responsible for producing about 40% of the oxygen we breathe!

            <div>
              <p>
                The ecosystem is the base for the existence of any organism.
                With the increasing human population, leading to an increased
                demand for resources, the activities lead to the destruction of
                the ecosystem and its stability. The major threat to the
                ecosystem is caused due to pollution. Air, water, and soil
                pollution possess deleterious activities on the ecosystem
                destroying the plant and animal populations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The waste materials released into the water bodies affect the
                aquatic ecosystems, thus affecting aquatic life. Deforestation
                carried out to procure land for agricultural purposes has led to
                an increase in air pollution. Other threats to the ecosystem
                include climate change, illegal fishing and wildlife trade,
                increasing industrialization, mining, poor sewage treatment
                methods, and many more.
              </p>
              <p>
                All these factors lead to a loss of biodiversity, with the
                extinction of animals and plants. Many species of plants and
                animals have become extinct with the increasing threat to
                biodiversity. These factors have led to a decreased quality of
                life for the human beings existing in the ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> These activities have made humans aware of how
                resources produced by the ecosystem are limited and the need for
                it to be conserved. A sustainable usage by conserving the
                resources, posing a very minimal threat to the organisms and the
                abiotic components should be practiced.

              <p>
                Ecosystems can recover from destruction, however. The delicate
                coral reef ecosystems in the South Pacific are at risk due to
                rising ocean temperatures and decreased salinity. Corals bleach,
                or lose their bright colors, in water that is too warm. They die
                in water that isnt salty enough. Without the reef structure, the
                ecosystem collapses. Organisms such as algae, plants such as
                seagrass, and animals such as fish, snakes, and shrimp
                disappear.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most coral reef ecosystems will bounce back from collapse. As
                ocean temperature cools and retains more salt, the brightly
                colored corals return. Slowly, they build reefs. Algae, plants,
                and animals also return.
              </p>
              <p>
                Individual people, cultures, and governments are working to
                preserve ecosystems that are important to them. The government
                of Ecuador, for instance, recognizes ecosystem rights in the
                countrys constitution. The so-called Rights of Nature says
                Nature or Pachamama [Earth], where life is reproduced and
                exists, has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate
                its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in
                evolution. Every person, people, community or nationality, will
                be able to demand the recognitions of rights for nature before
                the public bodies. Ecuador is home not only to rain forest
                ecosystems, but also river ecosystems and the remarkable
                ecosystems on the Galapagos Islands.

                There are many examples. Some of the examples in the video

                Humans can positively impact a saltwater ecosystem by being
                careful not to over fish. Humans can negatively impact a
                saltwater ecosystem by allowing fertilizer from farms to flow
                into the ocean, which can lead to blooms of algae. Too much
                algae can kill fish.

                In the winter, many animals migrate (move somewhere else) or
                hibernate (sleep for a long time) to avoid the cold of winter.
                Also, some trees lose leaves to conserve resources in the
                winter. In the spring, plants bloom around the same time that
                insects emerge to help pollinate the plants.

                Flowers in a garden provide nectar for birds, bees and other
                insects. Birds and insects transfer pollen between plants,
                helping the plants reproduce and survive. Trees provide shelter
                and nesting areas for animals like squirrels. Even small puddles
                in gardens are ecosystems! They contain algae, worms and
                insects.
